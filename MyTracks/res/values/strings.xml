    Use My Tracks while you run, bike, hike, or do anything else outdoors, and it will use the GPS
    sensor in your phone to record the path you took. It will also gather useful statistics such as
    time, speed, distance, and elevation. You can review all of this data live, or you can save it
    for use later. While you\'re out, you can mark relevant waypoints, and can ask to hear automatic
    voice announcements about your progress.\n

    My Tracks can record data from external sensors:\n
    - Zephyr Technology Consumer HxM Bluetooth heart rate monitor\n
    - Polar Bluetooth heart rate monitor\n
    - ANT+ heart rate monitors (*)\n
    - SRM power meters, speed, and cadence sensors (*)\n
    - More sensor support coming soon\n
    \n
    * ANT+ and SRM support requires an ANT+ compatible phone\n
    \n
    My Tracks can share your track data:\n
    - As a GPX, KML, CSV, or TCX file\n
    - Using Google Maps, Google Fusion Tables, or Google Docs\n

    The GPS receiver draws a relatively high amount of power, so a fully charged battery typically
    survives less than 5 hours. Battery life depends on many factors, including signal strength,
    battery freshness, and tasks running in parallel. Switching off some or all of the phone\'s
    radios will lengthen battery life. Putting the phone into Airplane mode will yield the best
    results.

    Cell signal or data connection is not required to record GPS tracks. However, if there is no
    data connection, you will not be able to see a map. Instead, you will see a grey screen or a

    GPS receivers measure elevations much less precisely than latitude and longitude. Elevations
    can sometimes be off by a few hundred feet, though relative changes are tracked more precisely.
    To get a good elevation measurement, make sure that you have a strong GPS signal and wait a few
    minutes for the elevation to settle to a stable value.
